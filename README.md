# Hyperdimensional Computing for Robotics

This project is part of my coursework at EMINES. Our team implemented key algorithms introduced in the article *An Introduction to Hyperdimensional Computing for Robotics* by Peer Neubert, Stefan Schubert, and Peter Protzel. The project focuses on the core ideas of Hyperdimensional Computing, exploring operations such as binding, bundling, and permutation within high-dimensional vector spaces.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To implement and demonstrate the basic algorithms of Hyperdimensional Computing for robotics applications.

- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **High-Dimensional Representation:** Leveraging the vast capacity of high-dimensional spaces for robust data encoding.  
  - **Vector Operations:** Implementing binding, bundling, and permutation to encode structured information.  
  - **Noise Robustness:** Utilizing the properties of high-dimensional spaces to ensure reliable performance even under noisy conditions.
